Monads in OCaml
===============

I've been reading the original monad paper called
[Monads for Functional Programming][MFP] and as an
excercise to understand monads better I decided to
re-implement the example code in OCaml.

Notable deviation from paper is that I'm using the
(nowadays) more conventional `>>=` operator instead
of `â‹†` as well as `return` instead of `unit`.
